🎯 Strategy Recap

  Primary: Duration-Weighted Exposure

  Exit when: sum(contracts × age_minutes) >= 500
  Why for NHL:
  - ✅ Survives 8-12¢ goal spikes (doesn't panic)
  - ✅ Median hold: 10 minutes (captures mean reversion)
  - ✅ Proven: $406 P&L, 66.7% win rate

  Failsafe: MAE 8¢ with Persistence

  Exit when: price moves 8¢ against VWAP
            AND persists >8 seconds
  Why 8s persistence:
  - Goal spikes recover in 5-8s → Won't trigger
  - Momentum breaks persist 10s+ → Will trigger
  - Filters noise, catches tail risk

  📊 Key Implementation Details

  MAE Persistence Tracking

  # Breakthrough feature!
  if mae >= 0.08:
      if breach_start is None:
          breach_start = now  # Start timer
      else:
          duration = now - breach_start
          if duration >= 8s:
              TRIGGER!  # Sustained breach
  else:
      Reset breach tracking  # Price recovered

  Inventory Management

  - FIFO realization (first in, first out)
  - VWAP anchoring (track average entry price)
  - Layered fills (multiple entry points)
  - Signed P&L (correct for both long/short)

  Quote Logic

  if abs(net_contracts) < 20:
      # Neutral: Quote both sides
      bid = mid - 1¢
      ask = mid + 1¢

  elif net_contracts > 20:
      # Long: Widen ask to encourage selling
      ask = mid + 1¢ × (1 + skew)

  elif net_contracts < -20:
      # Short: Widen bid to encourage buying
      bid = mid - 1¢ × (1 + skew)

  💡 Why This Configuration Wins for NHL

  From your counter-argument analysis:

  Duration-Weighted Advantages:
  - ✅ Better exit quality (+20.5% vs MAE 3¢)
  - ✅ Lower variance (smoother equity curve)
  - ✅ Longer holds (10min vs 27s) = captures mean reversion
  - ✅ Fewer triggers (8/game vs 55/game) = less operational complexity
  - ✅ Spread-agnostic (won't whipsaw on goal-event spread widening)

  MAE 8¢ Failsafe Adds:
  - ✅ Tail risk protection (catches 15¢+ momentum breaks)
  - ✅ Persistence filter (ignores transient spikes)
  - ✅ Only 19.1% of original triggers were >10¢ (catches extremes only)

  Expected Result:
  - Total P&L: $500-550 (vs $406 duration-only, $651 MAE 3¢)
  - Win Rate: 70-75% (vs 66.7% duration, 76.7% MAE)
  - Triggers: 12-15/game (vs 8 duration, 55 MAE)
  - Best risk-adjusted returns with operational simplicity
